## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_


Setting up a local Environment -

It is very important to set up a local environment to work on any project you want. 
This can be done in some simple steps.
1- Start with cloning the project in yopur local system. This can be done using your local terminal/bash. I personally used Visual studio code because it provides us with a integrated Terminal for this purpose. 
2- After cloning the project into your local machine and opening it in your system, We have to perform the required changed and push it again in our code base.
